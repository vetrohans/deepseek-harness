/**
 * The entry the packaged client runs instead of the official `dsh` bin.
 *
 * A packaged build carries no system Node, so the bundled CLI runs on
 * Electron's own Node through `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`. That variable is
 * inherited by everything the harness starts afterwards — including the
 * Agent's own shell commands — and any Electron-based tool the Agent then
 * runs (`code`, `electron`, an Electron-packaged CLI) starts as a bare Node
 * process and fails on its first `import { app } from 'electron'`. The
 * variable is an implementation detail of how this client launches Node; it
 * must not travel into the Agent's execution environment.
 *
 * It cannot simply be dropped: two runtime paths spawn `process.execPath`
 * expecting Node semantics — the native directory-picker worker (the "add a
 * project folder" dialog on macOS and Windows) and the Windows ACL sandbox
 * runner. So the variable is removed from the ambient environment and
 * re-attached at the spawn boundary, for children that are the Electron
 * binary itself. Every other child — the Agent's shells and their
 * descendants — sees the environment a normally installed `dsh` would give
 * them.
 *
 * Port of bruc3van/dsh-desktop src/main/runtime-launcher.ts (MIT).
 * @module dsh-desktop/runtime-launcher
